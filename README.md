### Abstract
  
  Accessibility is a right that the whole of society must ensure that it is fulfilled and improved. However, there are situations where its development is practically non-existent or non-existent in gestures that are as everyday as the simple fact of making the purchase by a person with visual impairment in physical establishments.

Even after the odyssey of making the purchase (either by resorting to online shopping or third parties) the problem continues to spread. In most cases, the packaging lacks basic information elements as important as its expiry date or food composition.

Avoiding cases such as those presented by both supermarket chains and manufacturers limits the rights of this sector of the population that they should be able to enjoy as consumers.

In this project, we want to propose a simple solution that sets a standard in the sector and is also simple enough in terms of both application and costs to be adopted quickly. Specifically, we propose an NFC labeling of all products on their side, so that by using a mobile application the user is able to know what he has in his hands (price, description, expiration ...) by simply bringing the mobile to that area of the product.
